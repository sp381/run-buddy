        <p>Hi everyone! I am a military spouse and mother of two small children. This lifestyle brings about a lot of change with new environments, new challenges and constant growth. I am excited to dive into the world of web developement. It's not my background but I am up for the challenge! In my free time I mostly hang out with my husband and children. I love to travel, find the best local spots and drink lots of coffee!
